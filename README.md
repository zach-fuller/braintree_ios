Welcome to Braintree's iOS SDK. This library will help you accept card and alternative payments in your iOS app.

**The Braintree iOS SDK requires Xcode 10+**. It permits a Deployment Target of iOS 8.0 or higher.

## Supported Payment Methods

- [Credit Cards](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/credit-cards/overview)
- [PayPal](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/paypal/overview)
- [Pay with Venmo](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/venmo/overview)
- [Apple Pay](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/apple-pay/overview)
- [ThreeDSecure](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/3d-secure/overview)
- [Visa Checkout](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/visa-checkout/overview)

## Installation

We recommend using either [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to integrate the Braintree SDK with your project.

#### Swift Package Manager
To add the `Braintree` package to your Xcode project, select File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and enter `https://github.com/braintree/braintree_ios` as repository URL. 
// TODO: more detail here on which sub-packages they will need to include.

Also, in your Project level Built Settings, you must define the Preprocesor macro `SWIFT_PACKAGE=1`. 
// TODO: is there a way we can export this macro from the SDK and not require merchants to manually define it?

#### CocoaPods
```
# Includes Cards and PayPal
pod 'Braintree'

# Optionally include additional Pods
pod 'Braintree/DataCollector'
pod 'Braintree/Venmo'
```

*Note:* If you are using version 4.x.x of the Braintree iOS SDK in Xcode 12, you may see the warning `The iOS Simulator deployment target is set to 8.0, but the range of supported deployment target versions is 9.0 to 14.0.99`. This will not prevent your app from compiling. This is a [CocoaPods issue](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7314) with a known workaround.

#### Carthage
Add `github "braintree/braintree_ios"` to your `Cartfile`, and [add the frameworks to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).
